#  ChurnSense: Customer Churn Prediction

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://customerchurnprediction-capstone.streamlit.app/)

ChurnSense is a premium, interactive web application built with Streamlit that predicts customer churn using Machine Learning. It features a modern, dark-themed UI with an active sidebar control panel and dynamic visualizations.

##  Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Choose between Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to predict churn risk.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time predictions update instantly as you adjust customer metrics in the control panel.
- **Key Business Drivers**: Automatically extracts and explains the primary factors influencing the churn probability tailored to the specific customer profile.
- **Premium Dark Mode UI**: A stunning, modern interface with a glass-morphic feel, gradient accents, and responsive layout.
- **Model Evaluation**: Transparent view into model performance metrics, confusion matrices, and feature importance.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. 

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn plotly joblib
   ```

### Training the Models

Before running the app, you MUST train the models to generate the required machine learning artifacts.

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```
This script will preprocess the `data/Customer-Churn.csv` dataset, train the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models, and save the models, scaler, metrics, and feature columns directly to the `models/` directory for the app to consume.

### Running the App

Start the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`, featuring an always-visible sidebar control panel securely anchored to the left.

##  Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit dashboard application with custom CSS styling and reactive components.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies list.
- `src/train_model.py`: The machine learning pipeline script (data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation).
- `data/Customer-Churn.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
- `models/*.joblib`: Serialized models, scalers, and metrics generated by `src/train_model.py`.

##  Machine Learning Details

- **Logistic Regression**: Generalizes well and provides highly interpretable probabilities for churn risk.
- **Decision Tree**: Captures non-linear relationships and provides an alternative viewpoint on customer behavior patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Auto-calculated features like `AvgMonthlySpend` enhance the predictive power of the original dataset.
